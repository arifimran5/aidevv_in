These are a few methods that are highly used in development and knowing these is a must. So let's begin!

# Map:

The `map()` method creates a new array from an existing one and applies the function to each one of the elements of the first array.

eg.

```jsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = numbers.map((item) => item * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

# Filter:

The `filter()` method returns the values based on the conditional statement. It checks the condition for each element of the array and if the condition is true is returns it otherwise not.

eg.

```jsx
const numbers = [4, 7, 12, 3];
const evens = numbers.filter((item) => item % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens); // [4, 12]
```

```jsx
const students = [
  { name: 'abc', attendance: 96 },
  { name: 'mno', attendance: 60 },
  { name: 'def', attendance: 89 },
  { name: 'jkl', attendance: 65 },
  { name: 'xyz', attendance: 40 },
];

const eligibleStudent = students.filter((student) => student.attendance >= 75);
return eligibleStudent; // [ { name: 'abc', grade: 96 }, { name: 'def', grade: 89}]
```

# Reduce:

The `reduce()` method reduces the array to a single value, executing the provided function on each element of the array.

**syntax: **

```jsx
array.reduce(function(total, currentValue, currentIndex, arr), initialValue)
```

Total (The initialValue, or the previously returned value of the function) and currentValue (value of the current element) are required parameters. InitialValue is optional, it sets the initial value of the array. If no initialValue is supplied, the first element in the array will be used as the initial. Calling reduce() on an empty array without an initialValue will throw a TypeError.

e.g.

```jsx
const euros = [29.76, 41.85, 46.5];
const sum = euros.reduce((total, amount) => total + amount);
console.log(sum); // 118.11
```

```jsx
var pilots = [
  {
    id: 10,
    name: 'Poe Dameron',
    years: 14,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Temmin 'Snap' Wexley",
    years: 30,
  },
  {
    id: 41,
    name: 'Tallissan Lintra',
    years: 16,
  },
  {
    id: 99,
    name: 'Ello Asty',
    years: 22,
  },
];

const totalYears = pilots.reduce((acc, pilot) => acc + pilot.years, 0);
console.log(totalYears); //82
```
